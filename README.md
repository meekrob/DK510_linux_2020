# DSCI512_linux_2020
Notebook files for DSCI 512 Linux 2020

## Source code for tree-1.6.0
I used the following commands within Vagrant/Virtualbox:

`yumdownloader --source tree`

`rpm2cpio tree-1.6.0-10.el7.src.rpm  | cpio -dium`

This created tree-1.6.0.tgz and other files which I'm not including here.
