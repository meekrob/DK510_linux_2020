# Notebook files for DCSI 510 linux (2020)

I've named the repo DK_ to make it easier to distinguish from students' other DSCI directories made in previous lectures.

## Run a server on jupyter.rc.colorado.edu

These notebooks must be completed on CURC Jupyterhub: https://jupyter.rc.colorado.edu/

## Get the course materials (if you haven't yet)

Once you are running a server on Jupyterhub:

1) Open a terminal from the launcher and type: git clone https://github.com/meekrob/DK510_linux_2020.git

2) This will create a directory called **DK510_linux_2020**

3) The directory will appear in your file browser, double click it to enter it.

4) The starter notebooks each end with _orig.ipynb, once you open one, do a Save As… to save it under a different name, preferably like “Variables.ipynb” for “Variables_orig.ipynb.”

If you need help with any of the above, see the [website version of the Variables notebook](http://rna.colostate.edu/2020/doku.php?id=wiki:2020scripting_ii_variables), or contact us with questions.
